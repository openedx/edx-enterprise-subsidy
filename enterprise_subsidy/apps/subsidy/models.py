"""
Model definitions for the subsidy app.

Some defintions:
* `ledger`: A running “list” of transactions that record the movement of value in and out of a subsidy.
* `stored value`:
      Value, in the form of a subscription license (denominated in “seats”) or learner credit (denominated in either
      USD or "seats"), stored in a ledger, which may be applied toward the cost of some content.
* `redemption`: The act of redeeming stored value for content.
