Captures and balances enterprise-subsidized transactions.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/enterprise-subsidy.git
  cd enterprise-subsidy
  make dev.up.build-no-cache
  ./provision-enterprise-subsidy.sh

Go visit http://localhost:18280/admin/ and login with the standard edx/edx credentials to confirm
that provisioning was successful.

Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # start the docker containers
  make dev.up.build # or docker-compose build --no-cache && make dev.up

  # enter the app container shell
  make app-shell

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make test
  # optionally make validate

  # Now, back on your host...
  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  # vim ...

  # Run your new tests
  make app-shell
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  # exit to your host again
  git commit ...
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Deploying
=========
Merging a pull request will cause a GoCD `build` pipeline to start automatically.
When the build pipeline is completed, the built image will be deployed to our staging
environment automatically.

To deploy your change to the production environment, you must manually trigger
the production `enterprise-subsidy-prod` pipeline, which will use the latest
commit in the ``main`` branch by default.
