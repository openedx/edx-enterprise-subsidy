Purpose
*******

Captures and balances enterprise-subsidized transactions.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------
.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/enterprise-subsidy.git
  cd enterprise-subsidy
  make dev.up.build-no-cache
  ./provision-enterprise-subsidy.sh

Go visit http://localhost:18280/admin/ and login with the standard edx/edx credentials to confirm
that provisioning was successful.

Every time you develop something in this repo
---------------------------------------------
.. code-block::

  # Grab the latest code
  git checkout main
  git pull

  # start the docker containers
  make dev.up.build # or docker-compose build --no-cache && make dev.up

  # enter the app container shell
  make app-shell

  # Install/update the dev requirements
  make requirements

  # Run the tests and quality checks (to verify the status before you make any changes)
  make test
  # optionally make validate

  # Now, back on your host...
  # Make a new branch for your changes
  git checkout -b <your_github_username>/<short_description>

  # Using your favorite editor, edit the code to make your change.
  # vim ...

  # Run your new tests
  make app-shell
  pytest ./path/to/new/tests

  # Run all the tests and quality checks
  make validate

  # Commit all your changes
  # exit to your host again
  git commit ...
  git push

  # Open a PR and ask for review.

Setting up openedx-events
-------------------------
Ensure you've installed the ``edx_event_bus_kafka`` and ``openedx_events`` requirements. Entering
a shell with ``make app-shell`` and then running ``make requirements`` should install these for you.

From your host, run ``make dev.up.with-events``, which will start a local kafka container for you.
Visit http://localhost:9021/clusters to access the local "Confluent Control Center".
Confluent is like a cloud wrapper around vanilla Kafka.

Your ``devstack.py`` settings should already be configured to point at this event broker,
and to configure enterprise-subsidy as an openedx event consumer and/or produer.

Start by switching over to your **enterprise-access** repo and make sure it has requirements installed.
We have a specific enterprise "ping" event and management command defined to test
that your local event bus is well-configured. Open a shell with ``make app-shell`` and run::

  ./manage.py consume_enterprise_ping_events

This will consume ping events from the ``dev-enterprise-core`` topic.
You may see a ``Broker: Unknown topic`` error the first time you run it.  When you run your
test event production below, that error will resolve (producing the event creates the topic
if it does not exist). **Leave the consumer running.** You should see the ``enterprise-access-service``
as a registered consumer in your local confluent control center.

Now, go back to your **enterprise-subsidy** directory. Make sure requirements are installed,
specifically the ``edx_event_bus_kafka`` and ``openedx_events`` packages. Use ``make app-shell``
in this repo and we'll *produce* a ping event::

  ./manage.py produce_enterprise_ping_event

If this event was successfully produced, you'll see a log message that says
``Message delivered to Kafka event bus: topic=dev-events-testing``.
You should also now see the ``dev-events-testing`` topic available in your local confluent control center,
and even the test events that are being published to the topic.

Deploying
=========
Merging a pull request will cause a GoCD `build` pipeline to start automatically.
When the build pipeline is completed, the built image will be deployed to our staging
environment automatically.

To deploy your change to the production environment, you must manually trigger
the production `enterprise-subsidy-prod` pipeline, which will use the latest
commit in the ``main`` branch by default.
